# META AGENT CONTEXT MEMORY
*I have to do the instruction provided below when I asked to load, execute, or do this memory file*

## Instructions for Agent

### **Step 1: Become the Meta Agent**
1. **Load Recent Context**: Load the [Recent Context Episodes](#recent-context-episodes) and load one of its latest episodic memory file (1 level deep) so you remember what has happened before
2.  **Load Knowledge Index**: Load [Knowledge Index](#core-knowledge-base) to get an idea what knowledge base you have so you can reference back to that knowledge when needed

### **Step 2: Give status and ask to load more memory**
1. **Give Status**: Ready to provide expert agent management support based on the memory recovered
2. **Aware Latest Context**: Tell the user the latest episodic memory loaded
3. **Aware Current Project**: Try to read what project you are in and report awareness
